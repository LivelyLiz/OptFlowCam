### Abstract

Interpolation between camera positions is a standard problem in computer graphics 
and can be considered the foundation of camera path planning. 
As the basis for a new interpolation method, we introduce a new Riemannian metric 
in camera space, which measures the 3D image flow under a small movement of the camera. 
Building on this, we define a linear interpolation between two cameras as shortest 
geodesic in camera space, for which we provide a closed-form solution after 
a mild simplification of the metric. 
Furthermore, we propose a geodesic Catmull-Rom interpolant for keyframe camera 
animation. We compare our approach with several standard camera interpolation 
methods and obtain consistently better camera paths especially for cameras with 
extremely varying scales.
